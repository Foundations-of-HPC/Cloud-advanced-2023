* Deploying our first application
#+begin_src
# deploy the application by using a manifest
kubectl apply -f main.yaml
# connecting to it by using a debug mode.
kubectl port-forward my-first-pod 40000:80 --address 0.0.0.0
# run a bash in your pod
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod -- bash
# remove everything created by the manifest.
kubeclt delete -f main.yaml
#+end_src

* Exercise:
- configure kubectl to connect directly form your laptop by copy the =admin.conf= on your home directory and try to port forward. You will not need to specify any address, why?
