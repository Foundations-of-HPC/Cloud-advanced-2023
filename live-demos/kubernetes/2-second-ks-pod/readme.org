* Deploying our second application

This pod is similar to the first one but leverages more Kubernetes features, particularly application monitoring and resource management.

Try to deploy this manifest, connect to it using the port forward, and see how Kubernetes reacts to different application behaviors.

* Questions:
- Slurm and Kubernetes perform resource management (CPU and RAM) leveraging the same Linux kernel features. Would you know its name?
- How does it come that when the application is not ready, you can still connect to it?
